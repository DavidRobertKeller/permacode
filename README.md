# permacoding

3 Ethics Foundations:
1) care for the planet: datacenter consuming less energy, using more renewable energies, algo optimized in machine time, etc.
2) care for Code: peer review, scalable, resilience, maintenance, evolution, etc.
3) fair share: open source, lib sharing, forum, tutorial, documentation, etc.

12 Principles:
1) Observe and interact: workshop, daily meeting, retro sprint, etc.
2) Catch and store energy: implementation of data lake and data mesh
3) Obtain a Yield: continuous integration and delivery
4) Apply Self-Regulation and Feedback: peer review, merge request, clean code, etc.
5) Use and Value Renewables: open source, code sharing between teams, etc.
6) Produce No Waste: remove and refactor the code.
7) Design from Patterns to Details: architecture, pattern design, TOGAF.
8) Integrate Donâ€™t Segregate: library creation, cloud and edge services publishing
9) Use Small, Slow (Dev) Solutions: start with small and smart code then iterate
10) Use and Value Diversity: use open-source, but also contribute to it
11) Use Edges and Value the Marginal: API by Design!
12) Creatively Use and Respond to Change: OKR-I (Objective KeyResults & Initiatives)!
